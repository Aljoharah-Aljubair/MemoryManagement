# MemoryManagement
CSC227: Operating Systems Course Project - Quarter 3 - 1444

**Memory Management System:**
The Contiguous Memory Management System is an application that enables the management of a contiguous region of memory using a fixed size partition scheme. This system allows for the allocation and deallocation of memory blocks based on different contiguous memory allocation approaches: First-fit (F), Best-fit (B), or Worst-fit (W).

***Features:***
Allocates memory blocks from available partitions based on the selected allocation strategy.
Deallocates previously allocated memory blocks.
Provides a status report about the current state of memory, displaying information about free and allocated memory blocks.

***Programming Language:*** JAVA

***How To Getting Started:***

**Step 1:** Run the application.

**Step 2:** The application will display a menu with the available options.

**Step 3:** Select an option based on your requirement:
Option 1: Allocate a block of memory.
Option 2: De-allocate a block of memory.
Option 3: Report detailed information about regions of free and allocated memory blocks.
Option 4: Exit the program.

**Step 4:** If you choose option 1 (Allocate a block of memory), you will be prompted to enter the allocation strategy (F, B, or W) and the size of the memory block you want to allocate.

**Step 5:** If you choose option 2 (De-allocate a block of memory), you will be prompted to enter the memory block identifier or any relevant information to identify the block you want to deallocate.

**Step 6:** If you choose option 3 (Report detailed information), the application will display a status report in console and also creat "Report.txt" file  providing information about the available and allocated memory blocks .

**Step 7:** Repeat steps 3 to 6 as needed until you are finished managing the memory.

**Step 8:** If you choose option 4 (Exit the program), the application will terminate.
