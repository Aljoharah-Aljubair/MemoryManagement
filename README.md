# MemoryManagement
CSC227: Operating Systems Course Project - Quarter 3 - 1444

**Memory Management System:**
The Contiguous Memory Management System is an application that enables the management of a contiguous region of memory using a fixed size partition scheme. This system allows for the allocation and deallocation of memory blocks based on different contiguous memory allocation approaches: First-fit (F), Best-fit (B), or Worst-fit (W).

***Features:***
Allocates memory blocks from available partitions based on the selected allocation strategy.
Deallocates previously allocated memory blocks.
Provides a status report about the current state of memory, displaying information about free and allocated memory blocks.

***Programming Language:*** JAVA
***Installation:***
To run the Memory Management System, you need to have Java installed on your system. If Java is not installed, you can download and install the latest version of the Java Development Kit (JDK) from the official Java website.
Additionally, you will need a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write and edit the Java code for the Memory Management System. Some popular options for Java development include Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans. Choose an editor or IDE that you are comfortable with or prefer for Java programming.
Once you have Java installed and an appropriate editor or IDE set up, you can proceed to run the Memory Management System by following the steps provided in the "How To Get Started" section below.


***How To Get Started:***

**Step 1:** Launch the Memory Management System application.

**Step 2:** The application will display a menu with several options.

**Step 3:** Choose an option based on your requirement:

Option 1: Allocate a block of memory.

Option 2: Deallocate a block of memory.

Option 3: Report detailed information about regions of free and allocated memory blocks.

Option 4: Exit the program.

**Step 4:** If you select option 1, you will be prompted to enter the allocation strategy (F, B, or W), the process ID, and the size of the memory block you wish to allocate.

**Step 5:** If you select option 2, you will be prompted to enter the process ID of the block you want to deallocate.

**Step 6:** If you select option 3, the application will display a status report in the console and create a "Report.txt" file that provides information about the available and allocated memory blocks.

**Step 7:** Repeat steps 3 to 6 as needed to manage the memory.

**Step 8:** If you select option 4, the program will terminate
